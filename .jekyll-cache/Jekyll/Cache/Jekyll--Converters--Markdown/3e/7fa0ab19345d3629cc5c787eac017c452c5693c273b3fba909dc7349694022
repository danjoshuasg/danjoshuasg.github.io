<p>The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes (the “vital few”).[1] Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity</p>

<p>Pareto’s observation was in connection with population and wealth. Pareto noticed that approximately 80% of Italy’s land was owned by 20% of the population.[7] He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found to his surprise that a similar distribution applied.</p>

<p>A chart that gave the effect a very visible and comprehensible form, the so-called “champagne glass” effect,[8] was contained in the 1992 United Nations Development Program Report, which showed that distribution of global income is very uneven, with the richest 20% of the world’s population generating 82.7% of the world’s income.[9] Among nations, the Gini index shows that wealth distributions vary substantially around this norm.</p>

<p>In computer science the Pareto principle can be applied to optimization efforts.[17] For example, Microsoft noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated.[18] Lowell Arthur expressed that “20% of the code has 80% of the errors. Find them, fix them!”[19] It was also discovered that in general the 80% of a certain piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time. This factor is usually a part of COCOMO estimating for software coding.</p>

<p>WordPerfect and other software developers identify what customers want most of the time and how they want to do it: the 80/20 rule (people use 20% of a program’s functions 80% of the time). Software developers work to make high-use functions as simple and automatic and inevitable as possible.[20]</p>
